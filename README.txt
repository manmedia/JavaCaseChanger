This is a Java project that I started working on (to commit to Github).

The resulting application will be able to change cases of a designated set of letters found in a text file.

My initial implementation of the case changer (or toggler) class is to use any vowels in a text file.


I have tried to use Abstract classes to make sure that people can take it and change it's implementation as needed. 

Any suggestions or feedback is highly encouraged. 


I also understand that somebody must have done it in their personal time, but kept in a local repo instead of central. My work is not intended to be a copy
of others' work. I am trying to strengthen my skills in Java by finding any problem that could be solved using core Java +/- any additional library/framework.
